# Rockbell

Multithreaded HTTP server built in Rust!

Rockbell is a barebones HTTP (GET) server that renders HTML, CSS, and JS files.

## Usage
Running this command will boot up the server and automatically connect to port `3005`.
```bash
$ cargo run
```

If you would like to run a test prior to starting the server, use this command:
```bash
$ cargo test
```
